 LP     Linear programming.                   
    X=LP(f,A,b) solves the linear programming problem:
         
             min f'x    subject to:   Ax <= b 
              x
    
    X=LP(f,A,b,VLB,VUB) defines a set of lower and upper
    bounds on the design variables, X, so that the solution is always in
    the range VLB <= X <= VUB.
 
    X=LP(f,A,b,VLB,VUB,X0) sets the initial starting point to X0.
 
    X=LP(f,A,b,VLB,VUB,X0,N) indicates that the first N constraints defined
    by A and b are equality constraints.
 
    X=LP(f,A,b,VLB,VUB,X0,N,DISPLAY) controls the level of warning
    messages displayed.  Warning messages can be turned off with
    DISPLAY = -1.
 
    [x,LAMBDA]=LP(f,A,b) returns the set of Lagrangian multipliers,
    LAMBDA, at the solution. 
    
    [X,LAMBDA,HOW] = LP(f,A,b) also returns a string how that indicates 
    error conditions at the final iteration.
 
    LP produces warning messages when the solution is either unbounded
    or infeasible.

Warning: The solution is unbounded and at infinity;
         the constraints are not restrictive enough.
